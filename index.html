        <p>
            I'm a veteran software engineer who learned to code in the 1980s on a C64 and have worked on many platforms, using different 3GL programming languages over time.
            I started humbly as a sysadmin in the 90s, then a Java software engineer during the first dot com boom, working on web applications for Dresdner Bank in Germany
            and later for Telstra, Allianz, News Corp, ABC and the ATO in Sydney. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 2010's I started working on mobile apps, which took me to work on several startups in SE Asia. 
            I'm now back in Australia and in a management role, but always find myself returning to my software engineering roots. 
            As of 2020, I'm mainly programming in Golang and You'll find me at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/golang-syd/">golang-syd</a>. 
        </p>
        <h2>What are you working on?</h2>
        <p>
            My main project as of 2023 is <a href="https://github.com/simonmittag/jabba">J8a</a>, a TLS1.3 reverse proxy for micro-services. It's design goal is to be
            a fast, secure, efficient and lightweight API gateway for DevOps engineers. Three years into it's development, it has grown into a sizeable project, and a Kubernetes 
            ingress-controller is under way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use a terminal on most days, and often find myself creating tools for the cli. <a href="https://github.com/simonmittag/p0d">p0d</a> is a lab testing tool for HTTP performance
            with comprehensive logging. <a href="https://github.com/simonmittag/pwt">pwt</a> blocks your CI pipeline while your servers start (so your tests don't fail too early). 
            <a href="https://github.com/simonmittag/l0la">l0la</a> is a sidecar for macOS, monitoring process resources during development time. All of these are available on macOS via homebrew.
        </p>
